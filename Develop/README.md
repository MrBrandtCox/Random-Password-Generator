# Random Password Generator JS

## Description
This project uses JavaScript to generate a randomized password for a user based on their selected preferences; capital and lower cased lettering, numbers, special characters, and password length. Each time the "Generate Password" is clicked, a new randomized password is displayed. 
<br/><br/><br/>

## User Story
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data,  
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria  
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security.
<br/><br/><br/>

## Acceptance Criteria
-  GIVEN I need a new, secure password:  
1. WHEN I click the button to generate a password  
   THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
   <br/><br/>  
2. WHEN prompted for password criteria  
   THEN I select which criteria to include in the password.
   <br/><br/>  
3. WHEN prompted for the length of the password  
   THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
   <br/><br/>  
4. WHEN asked for character types to include in the password  
   THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
   <br/><br/>  
5. WHEN I answer each prompt  
   THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.
   <br/><br/>  
6. WHEN all prompts are answered  
   THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
   <br/><br/>  
7. WHEN the password is generated  
   THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
